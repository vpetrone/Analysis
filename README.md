Analysis of the Travelling Salesman Problem as 'solved' through a variety of implementations

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) belongs to the set of NP-Complete problems in which we cannot
find a Polynomial time algorithm to solve. I present four possible solutions to this problem.
  -One finding an optimal solution by Brute force
  -One using a greedy algorithm
  -One using a minimum spanning tree (MST)
  -One using dynamic programming (BitonicTSP)
  
Try running each of these programs with different inputs and compare their results.
Some may find better solutions than others (not all are gauranteed optimal) and some
may not run well with larger inputs.
